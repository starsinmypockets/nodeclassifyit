sb,ykh,cj,,,,Confirm,Theresa Gasper with Marianne Williamson,"America is experiencing a dramatic moment of both peril and opportunity. Millions are asking, “What can I do to make a difference?”
 
 Join Marianne Williamson as she discusses how a revolution in consciousness paves the way to both personal and political renewal.
 
 What does it mean for a country to self-actualize?
 What would it look like for not only a person, but a collection of people, to become together all that we can be?
 How does individual freedom provide the greatest space for our collective genius to unfold?
 
 These questions underlie the possibility of a healed America: not merely a conversation about political externals, but rather a deeper, soulful, whole person consideration of what is possible in all of us, and through all of us, at this time in human history.
 
 There is hope.

,,,sb,ykh,cj,Delete,The Mondegreens Concert in support of Audrey Denney for Congress,"Join us in downtown Chico at the Naked Lounge Chico for a night of great music, featuring The Mondegreens with Chris Keene of Surrogate on Sunday, August 12th! Doors open at 7:30pm, show starts at 8pm! Tickets are $12 at the door. Online pre-sale tickets are $10: secure.actblue.com/donate/denney-greens
 
 The Mondegreens is a group of five Seattle-based musicians carving out a niche in the city's prolific indie rock scene, one that centers on wide dynamic swings and ever-present three-part harmonies. The group's two frontmen, David Friedlander and Russell Rabut, draw on over a decade of singing together, spinning harmonic webs across the peaks and valleys of the group's vibrant sound, their voices as likely to combine over a selection from Neil Young's back catalog, as a slacker rock anthem from their youth.

,,,sb,cj,,,"Watermen's Appreciation Day in St. Michaels, Md.","On Sunday, August 12, 2018, the 9th annual Watermen’s Appreciation Day comes to the Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum in St. Michaels, Md., featuring a spirited boat docking contest, steamed crabs and other regional food, live music, beer, boat rides, family activities, and more. The fundraising event is organized by CBMM in cooperation with the Talbot Watermen Association, with proceeds benefiting both organizations.
 
 Beginning at noon, the event’s “watermen’s rodeo” boat docking contest returns to the Miles River near CBMM's 1879 Hooper Strait Lighthouse. Bleacher seating will be provided for spectators to the contest. 
 
 “The boat docking contest is great fun to watch, and participate in,” said TWA President Jeff Harrison. “It’s a spirited day of celebrating the Chesapeake Bay’s watermen, from the rodeo, to the cold beer and hot crabs.” 
 
 The opportunity to meet the Chesapeake’s watermen, along with local steamed crabs, beer, and other food and beverages continue to highlight the waterfront festival. 
 
 Starting at noon, the day’s catch of steamed crabs—served by watermen—will be available for purchase, in addition to beer, water, soda, hot dogs, hamburgers, ice cream, and more. Steamed crabs will be sold by the dozen, with pricing set by July 27 and posted at cbmm.org. 
 
 “We’ve consistently been able to sell a dozen steamed crabs with corn on the cob at $25,” said Harrison. “We’re hoping this year’s market will allow us to do the same.”
 
 Also beginning at noon, live music with Bird Dog and the Road Kings from the historic Tolchester Beach Bandstand will have people tapping their toes and dancing along CBMM’s waterfront.
 
 Children and families can enjoy games and activities offered throughout the day. Later in the day, children’s on-the-water activities include a children’s row boat competition, with prizes awarded.
 
 During Watermen’s Day, event-goers can take part in a silent auction in the Small Boat Shed, with all proceeds supporting the Talbot Watermen Association.
 
 While at CBMM, guests can explore all 12 exhibitions buildings and see progress on the log-hull restoration of the 1889 bugeye Edna E. Lockwood, now underway in the shipyard through her launching at OysterFest on Saturday, October 27, 2018. Special exhibitions include Kent’s Carvers and Clubs: Guides, Gunners and Co-Ops: Exploring the Chesapeake: Mapping the Bay; and Lines of the Floating Fleet.
 
 Admission to the 10:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. rain or shine event includes the boat docking contest, live music, numerous family activities, entrance to all CBMM exhibitions and historic structures, and is set at $18 for adults, $8 for children 6-17, with all children five years of age and under admitted free. CBMM members along with licensed watermen and their immediate families get discounted admission at $10 per adult, and $6 per child ages 6-17. Food and beverages are additional. 
 
 Advanced admission tickets can be purchased online at bit.ly/watermensday, with tickets also sold at the door the day of the event. Discounted watermen’s tickets will be available at the door the day of the event, with an active watermen’s license shown. Boat rides, steamed crabs, beer, and additional food and beverages will be available for purchase. Free event parking will be available at St. Michaels High School, with a complimentary shuttle service to CBMM running throughout the day.
 
 For safety reasons, non-service dogs need to be kept home during CBMM festivals, including Watermen’s Appreciation Day. Leashed dogs are only permitted on CBMM’s campus during regular operating hours. Carry-on alcohol from dock or land is prohibited.
